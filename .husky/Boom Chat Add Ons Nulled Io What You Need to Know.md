But where can you get these add ons? Well, you can buy them from the official Boom Chat website or from Codecanyon. However, some people prefer to get them for free from nulled websites. Nulled websites are platforms that offer cracked or pirated versions of software or scripts. They claim to provide the same functionality as the original versions, but without any license or support.
 
However, getting Boom Chat add ons from nulled websites is not a good idea. Here are some of the reasons why:

- It's illegal: Downloading or using nulled software or scripts is a violation of intellectual property rights. You are stealing from the developers who worked hard to create them. You could face legal consequences if you get caught.
- It's risky: Nulled software or scripts may contain malware, viruses, backdoors, or other malicious code that could harm your website or server. They may also have bugs, errors, or compatibility issues that could affect the performance or security of your chat room.
- It's unethical: By using nulled software or scripts, you are depriving the developers of their deserved income and recognition. You are also hurting the quality and innovation of the software or script industry. You are not supporting the creators who make useful products for you.

Therefore, if you want to use Boom Chat add ons for your chat room, you should buy them from legitimate sources. You will get high-quality products that are safe, reliable, and updated. You will also get technical support and customer service from the developers. And most importantly, you will respect and appreciate their work.
